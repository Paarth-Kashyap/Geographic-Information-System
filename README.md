# ECE 297: Geographic Information System (GIS) Project

This repository contains the **final presentation** for **ECE 297: Software Design and Communication** at the **University of Toronto**.  
As part of this course, our team developed a fully functional **Geographic Information System (GIS)** using **C++**, **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** data, **GTK**, and **Glade**.

Due to academic integrity policies, the full source code cannot be made public. However, this presentation highlights the **features, design decisions, and technical innovations** we implemented throughout the project.

## Features Implemented

- **Interactive Map Visualization**
  - Displays real-world maps with **streets, intersections, TTC transit routes**, and **points of interest (POIs)**.
- **Points of Interest for Younger Users**
  - Curated POIs such as **parks, schools, libraries, and recreation centers** to make the map engaging for younger audiences.
- **Routing and Navigation**
  - Implemented **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and **A\*** for shortest pathfinding with real-time travel time estimates.
- **Search and Query Tools**
  - Search for intersections, POIs, and display detailed location information directly on the map.
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - **Multi-threading** and **preloading** reduced initial load times by **35%** and improved routing speed by **25%**, even with **50M+ nodes**.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, our team gained experience with:

- **Software Design:** Large-scale C++ modular development
- **Algorithm Optimization:** Multi-threading and performance tuning
- **GUI Development:** Integrating back-end logic with front-end rendering
- **Collaboration:** Agile sprints, version control, and formal design documentation

## Project Summary

This project showcases our ability to build a **feature-rich GIS application** from the ground up, focusing on **usability, performance, and scalability**. The combination of **real-world map data**, **routing algorithms**, and **interactive features** created a tool that is both **educational** and **technically robust**.
